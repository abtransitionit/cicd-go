# Todo: CI Improvements

## 1. Dependency Caching

* **Current behavior:** The workflow downloads Go modules on every run.
* **Issue:** Re-downloading dependencies for each workflow execution is inefficient.
* **Proposed improvement:** Cache Go module dependencies to significantly speed up subsequent runs.

## 2. Job Permissions

* **Current behavior:** Jobs run using the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
* **Issue:** The default token grants more permissions than necessary, potentially creating security risks.
* **Proposed improvement:** Explicitly configure job permissions to limit access to only what is required, for example when creating tags.
